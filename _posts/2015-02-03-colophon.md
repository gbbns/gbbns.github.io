This site is built using [Atom](http://atom.io), generated with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com).

The theme -- <span class="strike">for the minute, is based on the [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) template (with a number of tweaks and CSS improvements), so any similarities to any other sites is purely accidental</span> -- is far more custom as I've now gone out on my own and am designing as I go, as explained [here](/2016/01/working-redesign).

Font&rsquo;s are served from [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts) using both [Raleway](https://www.google.com/fonts) and [Vollkorn](https://www.google.com/fonts).

Next <span class="strike">I think I&rsquo;m going to add [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) comments to the blog posts</span>, as well as more social integration.
