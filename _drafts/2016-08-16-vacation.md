770.6 miles, that was what was on the car&rsquo;s ODO when I pulled up on the driveway after a week away.

The family had been to Devon, we left the previous Friday to visit the &lsquo;English Riviera&rsquo;. My only previous encounter with the South Coast had been a visit to the New Forest before a week on the Isle of Wight. We loved that trip and it&rsquo;s safe to say we enjoyed this.

Sadly 7 days isn&rsquo;t enough to recharge the batteries fully; especially having been stuck in hideous traffic on both the M5 and the M6, turning a 5hr drive into a 10hr+ beast.

Anyways, I digress slightly.

## Purpose of the post to be a retrospective look over a few articles related to Geek Mental Health issues -- Need a decent lead into the guts of the post

## Mental health awareness

Picture the scene, you have break your arm and end up having a cast. The next day you go to work and _everyone_ will ask you the same question &ldquo;how did you do that?&rdquo;. But, if you have a bad day, or week, or longer, how many people will actually take the time to ask you if everything is OK? I&rsquo;m guessing not that many, eh?

So why is it that we&rsquo;re willing to ask about a physical injury, but get scared shitless when it comes to mental health issues?

Now I&rsquo;m no expert on these issues, far from it infact, nor have I been diagnosed with any mental health issues, this is simply a retrospective look back over some issues that have plagued me and _have_ affected my mental health, that I know for sure, and if by sharing they can help at least one person, then I&rsquo;ll know it&rsquo;s been worth it.

### Trying to recognise Burnout

Burnout. This is a funny one. You&rsquo;ve no doubt heard it, or know someone who say&rsquo;s that they&rsquo;ve had it.

### Importance of personal reflection

Earlier on in [the year -- FIX LINK]({ 2016-02-19-motivation }) I talked, quite frankly, about a rough patch I&rsquo;d hit in one of my jobs.

It culminated with a 121 which opened my eyes to things and for the first time in a long time, made me sit and take stock of things.

### Having someone to talk to

A mentor, a friend, anyone.

### Go offline

Now the reason for me beginning this post about returning from my holidays was very deliberate. We'd booked a great holiday cottage in Devon, little did we know that both the signals for both mobile phones, as well as the Wifi, was awful.

We had zero phone signal pretty much across the site we stayed at and it was a good 20min drive to the local town before we managed to get 3g.

As for the Wifi, well, if it managed to stay connected for longer than 5mins you&rsquo;d struck gold.

Most of the family sighed; &ldquo;but what about my Snapchat?&rsquo; came the crys (mainly from the younger contingent). Me, I just sat a smiled as I knew that it meant one thing -- peace. Okay it meant that I&rsquo;d have a backlog of emails/texts/messages but that was the furthest thing from my mind.

It meant that I could speak to people without fearing about them, or I, looking at our phones. It meant I could spend some quality time with my Wife without fear or us looking at our phones. It meant I could spend some time with my son without him wanting to play but finding me on my phone.

But most importantly it meant that I was &lsquo;offline&rsquo; and it felt bloody marvellous.

## TL;DR;

It&rsquo;s important that you look after yourself. We all worry about getting fat, or drinking too much, or wearing the right clothes, but how many of us stop and take stock of how we're _really_ feeling?

It&rsquo;s actually OK to say no to things.

It&rsquo;s OK to turn your phone onto Airplane mode -- I&rsquo;ve actually got mine set to it right now on my commute home.

It&rsquo;s OK to ignore those annoying app notifications, better still try turning them off, you'll be surprised at just how liberating it actually is.

It&rsquo;s OK to leave the office at 5pm.

It&rsquo;s OK to take some time everyday to &lsquo;check in&rsquo; with yourself and your feelings.

It&rsquo;s OK to ignore all of this and do what works for you, just so long as you do. I didn&rsquo;t and it nearly caused me to leave an industry that, as it turns out, I actually quite like.
