I've known for a [while](/2016/02/19/motivation) that writing was going to be important to me this year, but as with all best laid plans...

I started of on a really good footing, I quite quickly managed to rattle of more posts in a single month than I'd managed in the 5+ previous years of trying. Then things slowed down. Life kind of took over. Whilst not exactly losing interest in blogging, or writing -- as I've managed to make quite a healthy list of things I wish to write about -- more I lost the initial discipline that I'd been under.

And then quite accidently I stumbled upon a tweet from the amazing [Ashley Baxter](https://twitter.com/iamashley/status/715103047068827648) regarding a ['30 day writing challenge'](https://marcjenkins.co.uk/the-30-day-writing-challenge/) from the extremely affable chap [Marc Jenkins](https://twitter.com/marcjenkins). Now given that I follow both of these folk on Twitter I was surprised that I'd missed the initial announcement, but hey, a quick tweet later to Marc and suddenly I was onboard.

I think the next feeling that passed, after the self gratifying thought that I'd managed to almost blag my way on, was **'FUCK, WHAT HAVE I DONE'**. After a little reflection, reading Marc's blog posts, and having a chat on Slack, I realised that I _could_ do this, but more importantly I _wanted_ to do it.

And with that here are my goals for the next 30 days:

* To write for at least 30 minutes per day
* To have at least 10 posts published in April

Obviously these are my targets, I reality I know that I can be quite hard on myself so will inevitably want to smash them.

Lets go!
