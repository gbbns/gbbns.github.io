This is the website and source code for Chris Gibbons, a front end web developer from just outside [Blackpool](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackpool).

As it explains in my [colophon](http://www.chrisgibbons.co.uk/2015/02/03/colophon) the site is built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

All code &amp; content is &copy; 2016 of Chris Gibbons.
