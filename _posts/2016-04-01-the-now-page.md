I like the idea of a now page. It's got a point. It's not on the site to bullshit, it's there to tell people what you, or I, are doing _now_.

From time to time I get asked what am I doing, what am I working on and if it's anything good, do I have any side projects on the go, how's my photography coming on, etc...

I first came across the _now_ page on [Marc's site](marcjenkins.co.uk/now/) and was instantly hooked on it, and as he'd handily included links to [other](https://sivers.org/nowff) [sites](http://nownownow.com/) where he himself had got inspiration.

It maybe slightly voyeuristic to some, useless to most, or never used for the majority. But for me, I quite like it, and for the occasional person who stumbles across it, then I hope you find it useful as well.

If you _do_ wish to see what I'm doing now, then [feel free](/now)
