This site is built using [Atom](http://atom.io) and generated with the amazing [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com).

The theme, for the minute, is based on the default template installed by Jekyll, so any similarities to any other sites is purely accidental.

Font&rsquo;s are served from [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts).

Next I think I&rsquo;m going to add [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) comments to the blog posts, as well as more social integration.
