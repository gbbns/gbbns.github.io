My last project whilst at Code was FE lead on the platform team responsible for pushing some new parts of a responsive site live, this can be seen over at [Hillarys Carpets](http://www.hillarys.co.uk/carpets) and [Hillarys - Book an Appointment](http://www.hillarys.co.uk/book-an-appointment)

Rather than a full re-platform, we decided to tackle it section by section and transition over a period of 9-12 months. We used some React (with Babel + WebPack) along with the usual suspects of Gulp/Sass et al.

Other work I've helped to produce whilst at Code include:

Client - [BettaLiving](http://www.bettaliving.co.uk)

This again has had various iterations, the latest was as a result of A/B testing different homepages and merging results over time.

Client - [Transpennine Express](http://www.tpexpress.co.uk)

An older site, the client wanted an adaptive experience due to stakeholder requirements for mobile. Due to budget and the rail tender this site hasn't had as much work done on it recently.

Other clients I&rsquo;ve been fortunate to work with include:[Blinds Supermarket](http://www.blinds-supermarket.co.uk), [Velvet Tissue](www.velvettissue.com) , [Hull Trains](http://www.hulltrains.co.uk), [Bayer Cropscience](http://www.bayercropscience.co.uk), [Aldermore](http://www.aldermore.co.uk).

Within the Code FE team, three of us produced an FWA site of the day for a personal project - [Oh-Ley](http://www.oh-ley.com/ for the world cup last year.
