80/20 time, long pioneered by the internet giant Google, has been seen by many within the industry as a staple for innovation, and has brought to life many of the companies most iconic products such as Gmail, Adsense, or Google Reader.

Since the start of the year, we've been trialling having some protected free time on a Friday, either to fix and unify our local dev environments, or start some learning sessions, through to group UX sessions. All of them have had _some_ benefits, none more so that the Friday UX session, or FUX as it was coined.

As a squad, over the course of a number of months, we had all identified some major pain points on the website, and at one point or another had raised our concerns. During a squad sprint retro, I again raised this point and took an action to run an ideation session.

Leveraging the talents of the wonderful [Mr Fritz](link/to/fritz/site) the two of us ran a FUX.


<---- Rules on ideation ---->

<----- How did we run the session ------>

<--- How did we formulate outcomes? ------>


Overall, despite the initial apprehension, the session was extremely successful. We had a positive, tangible outcome; we've even managed to repeat the session, with more planned!

The point I'm trying to make is that once you get over the fact that no one is working on 'billable hours', the benefits you can gain are immeasurable. We all felt more empowered as well as more enthusiastic, but more importantly we felt connected to what we _could_ potentially be doing as we as a group had devised the solution. That alone is priceless.
