title:  "UI overhaul"
---
I've never _truly_ been happy with my site, it's always been in a state of redesign, typical for a UI dev, eh?!

After installing [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) early last year I finally felt that I had the beginnings of something I was beginning to like and _actually_ enjoy using.

Fast forward a year -- more to come on that soon -- and I find myself back at the beginning, albeit with a platform I'm _still_ happy with.

And so begins a new re-design/re-align.

To get going with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), and to get something live, I decided to go with the [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) template until I got time to do something bespoke, and now that time has arrived...

A lot of the new work is going to be done in the browser, and in all honesty will be a little trial & error!

Please feel free to poke around the code over at the [repos](https://github.com/point12/point12.github.io), as well as reporting any bugs etc.
