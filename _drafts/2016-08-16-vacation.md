770.6 miles.

That was what was on the car's ODO when I pulled up on the driveway after a week away.

The family had been to Devon, we left the previous Friday to visit the 'English Riviera'. My only previous encounter with the South Coast had been a visit to the New Forest before a week on the Isle of Wight. We loved that trip and it's safe to say we enjoyed this.

Sadly 7 days isn't enough to recharge the batteries fully; especially having been stuck in hideous traffic on both the M5 and the M6, turning a 5.5hr drive into a 8hr+ beast.
